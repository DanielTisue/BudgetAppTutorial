# Budget App Tutorial
* This was a tutorial by Jonas Schmedtman. The app involves an exploration an use of OOP, Array methods, String methods,  DOM manipulation, and various types of functions, and nested functions.

## Summary

In the budget app you can add profit(income) and deduct expenses. Every time an item is entered the top View showing the total is updated as well as each individual income/ or expense which is listed below. It is also formatted to display the current month and year. Originally the tutorial included percentages, however I did not include that in this version.
